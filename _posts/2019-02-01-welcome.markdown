### Team A (JollyRoger)

Hello world and **welcome** to our ship!

We are a bunch of roboticists here at CMU taking mechatronics for our
capstone design class. The goal of our project is to build a autonomous
robot which could operate electromechanical devices on ships to reduce
labor cost and risks associated with manual operations.

To meet our team, please visit the "About" link above in the navigation bar.
